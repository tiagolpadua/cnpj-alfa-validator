# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a TypeScript library for validating Brazilian CNPJ (Cadastro Nacional da Pessoa Jur√≠dica) numbers, including alphanumeric CNPJs. The validation logic is based on SERPRO's implementation and supports both traditional numeric CNPJs and the newer alphanumeric format.

## Development Commands

- **Build**: `npm run build` or `tsdx build`
- **Development**: `npm start` or `tsdx watch` (watches for changes)
- **Test**: `npm test` or `tsdx test`
- **Test with watch**: `npm run test:watch`
- **Test with coverage**: `npm run test:coverage`
- **Lint**: `npm run lint` or `tsdx lint`
- **Lint and fix**: `npm run lint:fix`
- **Bundle size analysis**: `npm run analyze`

## Architecture

The codebase follows a simple, focused structure:

- **Core Logic**: Single `CNPJ` class in `src/index.ts` with two main static methods:
  - `isValid(cnpj: string)`: Validates complete CNPJ with check digits
  - `calculaDV(cnpj: string)`: Calculates check digits for 12-character CNPJ base
  
- **Algorithm**: Uses weighted sum calculation with specific weights for each position, supporting both numeric (0-9) and alphabetic (A-Z) characters

- **Input Handling**: Automatically removes formatting characters (dots, slashes, hyphens) and validates against regex patterns

- **Error Handling**: Throws descriptive errors in Portuguese for invalid inputs during DV calculation

## Key Implementation Details

- Supports alphanumeric CNPJs with uppercase letters A-Z and digits 0-9
- Rejects all-zero CNPJs as invalid
- Uses ASCII value calculations for character processing
- Pre-commit hook runs linting automatically via Husky
- Bundle size limit enforced at 10KB for both CJS and ESM builds

## Testing

Tests are comprehensive and cover:

- Valid CNPJ validation (both numeric and alphanumeric)
- Invalid input rejection
- Error cases for DV calculation
- Edge cases like empty strings, invalid characters, wrong lengths
